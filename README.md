whisper-blog
========

Lightweight blogging that is halfway between Twitter and Tumblr.
Aim is to hve something that can hold a little more than a Tweet, but not to the point of a full-featured blog. This is my vision of what a "Micro-Blog" should have.

CSS Preprocessor: LESS
Design Framework: Zerb Foundation
Testing: Mocha with Chai and Chai-as-Promised
Backend: NodeJS (promise based)
Frontend: Hybrid normal requests with some Angular enhancements.
