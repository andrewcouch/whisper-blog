static-site
========

Static site structure for small website.

I have a few projects that work perfectly well as static sites. They change fairly infrequently and don't need a database behind them. And yet I want to be able to use bootstrap and LESS and other parts of my workflow that work well for larger sites. 

This is my basic static site from which I build my others. 

The LESS version of the bootstrap source is expected in /source/bootstrap.

Things that could be better
========
* Some JS shim packed onto a class so that adjacent columns can be set to the same height.
* Bootstrap & JQuery updater. Grunt Plugin or Bower?
